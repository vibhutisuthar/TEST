	<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for www.travelbytes.com.au.
	  We have designed Travel Bytes’ Web Site so that no personal
	  identifying information is displayed online or is accessible to
	  the general public.</p>

	<h3>How is personal information collected?</h3>
	<p>Travel Bytes is a specialised Travel and Tourism Communication
	  business. In order to provide customers with a quality service,
	  Travel Bytes offers customers the ability to purchase and utilise
	  products and services through three different sales and support
	  channels:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A call centre, provides telephone support service,</li>
		<li>In-person sales and services, and</li>
		<li>Online sales and email support.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>These channels reflect the
	  different ways in which Travel Bytes may collect personal information
	  about customers. Collection will occur at the time you make a purchase,
	  use our services or when you register as wishing to receive information
	  about our products and services, through our website.</p>

	<h3>Non-customer information</h3>
	<p>Sometimes, Travel Bytes needs
	    to collect personal information about individuals who are not
	    customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name
	    and business contact details of a person who is the contact in
	    a government agency or company with whom we deal. Travel Bytes’ policy
	    is to only use personal information collected from non-customers
	    for the main business purpose for which it was collected.</p>

	<h3>What personal information does Travel Bytes collect, and why?</h3>
	<p>If you purchase products or services from Travel Bytes, we need
	  to collect personal information about you, including your name,
	  address and telephone number. The reason we need this information
	  is so we can contact you to maintain communication with you, in
	  the provision of our services. We may also ask you to provide us
	  with information regarding your personal or professional interests,
	  demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed contact
	  preferences. You will have the option of choosing not to provide
	  us with this information. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will
	  use personal information about you for marketing and research purposes.
	  You can let us know if you no longer wish to receive marketing
	  material - all you need to do is contact Travel Bytes (the contact
	  details of our Privacy Officer are below).</p>

	<h3>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Travel Bytes uses your information to better understand your needs
	  and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your
	  information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate
	  back to you, to update you on service, products &amp; benefits,
	  to personalise our web sites for you, research our audience’s
	  travel preferences, interests and behaviour and gather broad non-identifying
	  demographic and socio-economic information. <br>
	  Unless we have your permission
	  or are required by law, we do not sell or provide the information
	  collected or stored about you, to third parties who are not our
	  contractors or business partners. Furthermore, we do not send out
	  unsolicited e-mail.</p>

	  web sites.</p>

	<h3>Log Files</h3>
	<p>Travel Bytes maintains log files of the traffic that visits the
	  Travel Bytes site. We do not link any information gathered in these
	  log files to personally identifying information. Log files are
	  used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements
	  for providing reliable service. Information collected includes
	  IP addresses and browser types.</p>
	  
	<h3>Information and Data Security</h3>
	<p>All personal information collected is stored and maintained in
	  a secure database that limits access to authorised personnel only,
	  through a series of access-control procedures. All Travel Bytes
	  employees are briefed about the company's privacy and security
	  policies on a regular basis, and are required to treat personal
	  information held by Travel Bytes as confidential. The Travel Bytes
	  Web site is regularly tested for security breaches to ensure that
	  all information collected is secure from unauthorised viewing.</p>

	<h3>Access and correction</h3>
	<p>To ensure your privacy, only
	    you can see your personal details and you may access your personal
	    information details to correct information that is inaccurate,
	    incomplete or out of date. If you would like to change your information
	    on our database, please e-mail this request to: privacy@travelbytes.com.au.</p>

	<h3>Notification of Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>Travel Bytes may change its Privacy Policy at any time. If we
	  change our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice
	  on our website. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
	  information in a manner different from that stated at the time
	  it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have
	  a choice as to whether or not we use their previously submitted
	  information in this different manner. Users may choose to have
	  their information used in accordance with the privacy policy under
	  which the information was collected.</p>
