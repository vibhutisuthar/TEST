							<br/>
							<span class="RemarkSubHeader">Important
        Information for Travelers:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; American Express Travel Service is a partner in the 
							Charter for Safe Travel. We recommend that you consult Department of Foreign 
							Affairs and Trade web site at http://www.smartraveller.gov.au and take note of 
							the travel advisory information on that web site. The Department of Foreign 
							Affairs and Trade operates a 24hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 
							(in Australia) or + 61 2 6261 3305.<br/>
							<br/>
							<span class="RemarkSubHeader">We also recommend that you consider the following 'Safe Travel'
        - Top 10 Tips:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<br/>
							1. Read up on where you're going. Check on safety and related developments at 
							your destination by reading country-specific travel advisories available from 
							the Department of Foreign Affairs and TRADE website.<br/>
							2. Consult a 'safe travel' partner organization for professional advice on 
							in-country travel, accommodation and good travel preparation.<br/>
							3. Get the necessary visas for the country or countries you are visiting but be 
							aware that a visa does not guarantee entry.<br/>
							4. Check that you hold appropriate travel insurance to cover hospital 
							treatment, medical evacuation and the kind of activities you plan to take. 
							Overseas medical costs are expensive and Medicare and Australian private health 
							insurance will not cover you outside Australia.<br/>
							5. For longer stays in a country, or where the security situation is volatile, 
							register your details at the local Australian embassy, high commission or 
							consulate, or online. This will help us help you in an emergency.<br/>
							6. Know where to get help if you're in trouble. Ensure you have the contact 
							details of the local Australian embassy, high commission or consulate in the 
							country in which you're traveling.<br/>
							7. Keep in regular contact with friends and relatives back in Australia by 
							phone or email and leave a travel itinerary.
							<br/>
							8. Check with health professionals for information on recommended vaccinations 
							or other precautions.<br/>
							9. Protect your personal information and make copies of your passport details, 
							insurance policy, traveler’s cheques and credit card numbers. Carry one copy 
							and leave a copy with someone at home. Carry additional copies of your passport 
							photo with you.<br/>
							10. Don't carry illicit drugs. In some countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, 
							Singapore and Thailand drug offences carry the death penalty.<br/>
